#Behaviour Driven Development
##using Cucumber with Groovy

A presentation written with [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) dealing with BDD in the realm of Groovy.

We define what BDD is, look at the pros and cons, and finally take a deep dive into the technology.

We build a simple application demonstrating a typical development flow, using Gradle to drive Cucumber JVM.

We then take a closer look at the Cucumber Grails plugin, and what is required to integrate it in your next application.
